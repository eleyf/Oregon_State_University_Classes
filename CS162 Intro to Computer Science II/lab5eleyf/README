The program is incomplete. The main program makes 5 steps to demonstrate
that the virtual move function works for both the Ant and Doodlebug classes.

I was unable to successfully create a =operator overload for the Grid class.
Something in its internal logic is creating a seg fault.

The basic logic of the completed program would be:

	Get number of steps from user
	Create a main grid and a temp grid
	Create 5 Ants and 100 Doodlebugs in the main grid
	Loop through main grid
		If Doodlebug exists
			Eat Ant or plain move
	Update temp grid
	Loop through main grid
		If Ant exists
			Move
	Update temp grid
	Set main grid to temp grid
