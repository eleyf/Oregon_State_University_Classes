lab 7


This lab implements a linear search, a binary search, and an insert sort.

The folder contains 4 test files:

noZero: contains random numbers 1 - 9.
early: contains random numbers 0 - 9 with zero early in the sequence.
middle: contains random numbers 0 - 9 with zero in the middle in the sequence.
late: contains random numbers 0 - 9 with zero late in the sequence.

1. Type make to create the executable.
2. Type lab7 to run the program.
3. Type 1 to run a linear search on one of the test files.
	When prompted enter one of the file names; noZero, early, middle, late.
	Sequence data is listed below.
4. Type 2 to sort one of the test files.
	When prompted type in the name of the file you want the sorted list written to.
5. Type 3 to run a binary search on one of the sorted files created in step 4.
	The position will corespond to the number entered since the list is now sorted.


noZero:   8 5 4 9 2 3 6 1 7
position: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

early:   8 0 5 4 9 2 3 6 1 7
postion: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

middle:  8 5 4 9 2 0 3 6 1 7
postion: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

late:    8 5 4 9 2 3 6 1 0 7
postion: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9


NOTE:

The linear search algorithm used is based on the example given in
the CS162 Intro to Progamming II Searching slide page 6.

The insert sort algorithm used is based on the example given in C++
Early Objects 8th Edition - Gaddis pg 611.

The binary search algorithm used is based on the example given in
the CS162 Intro to Progamming II Searching slide page 11.
