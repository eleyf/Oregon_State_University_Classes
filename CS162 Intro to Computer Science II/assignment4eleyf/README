cs162 assignment4


The program plays a combat game between two lineups of fighters
created by the user.

Type "make" to build the program.
Type "assignment4" to begin the program.
When prompted choose the number of fighters in each lineup.
Choose the type of fighters in the lineup for each player.


NOTE: I did not receive feedback on assignment 3 until Saturday 11/19/16.
	  The program does not allow users to enter a name for each fighter.
	  When I attempted to add a name member to the Creature class it created
	  seg faults. Due to lack of time I opted to display the Creature types
	  to verify the lineup queues and defeated list. The queues and list
	  are displayed as Enum values of the creature types as follows.

	  0 = VAMPIRE, 1 = BARBARIAN, 2 = BLUEMEN, 3 = MEDUSA, 4 = HARRY POTTER

	  After each round of battle the winner of that round is declared. The
	  updated scores, the lineups of each player, and the defeated list are
	  also displayed.

	  After a lineup has been defeated the final score and winner is displayed.
