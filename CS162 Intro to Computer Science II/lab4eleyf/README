eleyf lab 4 recursive functions

This program demonstrates the use of three recursive functions.

1. printing the reverse of a string
2. calculating the sum of an array of integers
3. calculating the triangular of an integer

To utilize the program:

1. type "make"
2. type "lab4"
3. type in the choice (1 - 3) of the function that you want to use or 4 to exit the program

	1. 	Reverse of string: type in a string and hit enter.
		The string will be printed in reverse order.

	2.	Sum of array: the function will calculate the sum of an array of up to 20 integers.
		Type in each integer amount followed by a space. type in # to indicate the end of 
		the array.

		EX. for array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		type in "1 2 3 4 5 #"

	3.	Triangular: type in an inter. The triangular of the interger will be printed.
