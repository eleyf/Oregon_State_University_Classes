cs162 lab9

This program implements a STL queue to simulate a buffer
and a STL stack to create a palindrome.

Type make to build the program.
Type lab9 to begin the program.

From the main menu choose 1 to simulate a buffer,
choose 2 to create a palindrome, or
choose 3 to exit the program. 

1. Buffer simulation
	a. Enter the percentage values created to enter the
		buffer. The percentage should be an integer between
		0 and 100. Ex. 25 for 25% chance of adding to buffer.
	b. Enter the percentage values to be removed from the
		buffer. The percentage should be an integer between
		0 and 100. Ex. 75 for 75% chance of adding to buffer.
	c. Enter the number of rounds to run the simulation.

2. Palindrome
	a. When prompted enter a string of characters.
	b. The palindrome of the string will be displayed.
